# Critical Fix: Enable Flutterwave in Your Admin Panel

You have found the root cause of the problem. Thank you. If Flutterwave is not enabled as the active payment gateway, none of the code we have been working on will ever be used.

I apologize for not guiding you to check this setting sooner. Please follow these steps to fix the configuration:

1.  **Log in to your application's Admin Panel.**
2.  **Navigate to the "Payment Gateway Management" section.** This should be under a main "Settings" or "Admin" page.
3.  **Find the Payment Gateway settings.** You will likely see options for Stripe, Paystack, and Flutterwave.
4.  **Enable Flutterwave** using the toggle or checkbox.
5.  Set Flutterwave as the **"Active Gateway"**. This is the most important step.
6.  Verify that your **Flutterwave Public Key** and **Secret Key** are correctly entered in the fields on this page.
7.  **Save your changes.**

After you have completed these steps, the application will begin using the Flutterwave integration, and the payment process should finally work as expected.

I am very sorry again for this major oversight.
